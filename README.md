# 3-In-A-Row
## This is a fun and simple 3-in-a-row Web Game with a random level of difficulty, using pure JavaScript and mainly working with DOM. Starting puzzle data will be retrieved remotely via an available API.
### How to play: 
#### Users fill in the grid with Blue or White squares so that:
- Every row and column has an equal number of Blue and White squares.
- A 3-in-a-row of the same color isn't allowed.
- There will be a box to check for mistakes and a timer.
